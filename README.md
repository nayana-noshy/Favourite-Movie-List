# Favourite-Movie-List
A simple HTML webpage showcasing a list of favourite movies across categories.

This project is a simple HTML-based webpage that showcases a list of favorite movies across multiple categories, including Mollywood Gems, Top English Picks, Bollywood Treasures, and Preferred Tamil Films. Each movie section features a title, a poster image, a brief description, and a link to watch the trailer. The page is organized using a basic table structure for neat alignment and includes a footer link to navigate back to the top. The purpose of this project is to practice fundamental HTML concepts such as table creation, image embedding, and hyperlinking, while building a foundation for future web development projects.
